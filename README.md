## ✏️ About

This project was developed on Stage 8 in the Explorer course at the [Rocketseat School](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/). To access the entire course assignments click [this link](https://github.com/jeadamek/explorer-rocketseat). 


The primary objective of this project was to learn how to build an API using Node.js. The API forms a crucial component of a larger application that we plan to develop in the subsequent two stages of the course.

The API was specifically designed to function as a database for storing useful links and notes. To accomplish this, were utilized tools as SQLite, Beekeeper Studio, and Query Builder Knex.js. These tools were instrumental in creating a robust and efficient database that can store large amounts of data securely.

Overall, this project was an exciting opportunity to gain practical experience in building APIs using Node.js and working with cutting-edge database technologies. The skills and knowledge gained from this project will be invaluable in future development work and in enhancing our abilities as developers.

I could practice and study:

- API REST built in NodeJS e ExpressJS;
- SQLite database to save the data;
- Tool Beekeeper Studio;
- Query Builder with Knex.js;
- Node.js middleware for handling multipart/form data;
- Promises with Async Await;
- Multer, node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files;
- JWT with jsonwebtoken;
- Classes and events;
- Inheritance and Polymorphism;
- Route mapping;
- Insomnia to register routes and check status codes;
- Asynchronous and promises;
- Object orientation;
- Callbacks Functions;
- ES6 Modules;
